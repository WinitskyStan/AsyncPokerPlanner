# Async Poker Planner

This is still a work in progress. The idea is to have a tool for async poker planning sessions.

Instead of having many long meetings debating if a story 2, 3, 5 or 8, we can plan and estimate features in an async manner. Allowing developers to take ownership of planning and estimation while still allowing for feedback and discussion.

Users can vote on a story, add details, and leave comments. The votes and comments will be visible to all users in the room once ready to share.

User can also compare the estimates of other users previously voted on the same group, allowing for a more informed decision.

## Running the application

Open the project in an IDE. You can download the [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) if you do not have a suitable IDE already.
Once opened in the IDE, locate the `Application` class and run the main method using "Debug".

For more information on installing in various IDEs, see [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started/import).

If you install the Vaadin plugin for IntelliJ, you should instead launch the `Application` class using "Debug using HotswapAgent" to see updates in the Java code immediately reflected in the browser.

## Deploying to Production

The project is a standard Maven project. To create a production build, call 

```
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
```

If you have Maven globally installed, you can replace `./mvnw` with `mvn`.

This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,ready to be run. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.
You then launch the application using 
```
java -jar target/async-poker-planner-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses
  [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/docs/components/app-layout).
- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `src/main/frontend` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
- `themes` folder in `src/main/frontend` contains the custom CSS styles.
